 1. Create a class named **Product** with the following instance variables
 - List item
 - productCode of type String.
 - productName of type String.
 - productPrice of type double.
Create another class **TestProduct** with a main method to test above class
- create an object of Product and display the values of instance variables
- create another object, assign values to member variables and display the values of member variables

**Output Format:**
The object data should be displayed in the following format: 

Product Code : P101

Product Name : Laptop 

Product Price : 45000.00

2. Create a class named **Product** with the following private instance variables:
-	productCode of type String
-	productName of type String
-	productPrice of type double
Include Getters and Setters for all the variables.
Create another class **TestProduct** with a main method to test above class
-	create another object of Product class and assign values to member variables using setters
-	Display the values of member variables using getter methods

**Output Format:**
The object data should be displayed in the following format:

Product Code : P101

Product Name : Laptop

Product Price : 45000.00


3.Create a class named **Product** with the following private instance variables:
- productCode of type String
- productName of type String
- productPrice of type double
	- Include a parameterized constructor with 3 parameters to initialize the member variables.
	- Include a method **displayProductDetails** to display object state in the following format. This Method does not accept any parameters and does not return anything.

***Product Code : P101 Product Name : Laptop Product Price : 45000.00***
* Create class **TestProduct** with a main method to test above class
	- Create an object using the parameterized constructor.
	-	Invoke **displayProductDetails** method and display the product details.

4. Create a class named **MyUtil**
	- Create a static method throwDice which should return a random number between 1 and 6 inclusive. (hint: use random method of Math class)
	- Create a static method findAverage which takes an array of integers as parameter. The method should return the average of the integers present in the array.
- Create a class TestMyUtil with a main method.
	-	Test the throwDice method
	- Create two integer arrays and find the average of both the array elements using findAverage method
	-  Find the max and min of two doubles by using static methods of Math class
	-	Find the ceiling, floor and round of a number by using static methods of Math class.
	
5. Create a class named **Product** with the following private instance variables
	- productCode of type String
	-	productName of type String
	-	productPrice of type double
	- categoryCode of type char (E- electronics, A - apparels, T – toys)
	- Include a private static variable **prodCounter** of type int initialized to 100. Create getters and setters for all variables
	- Create a private method **generateProductCode** which will return the product code as String. Product code is derived by concatenating categoryCode and incremented product counter.
	- Include a parameterized constructor with 3 parameters ( productName, productPrice, categoryCode). prodCode should be assigned in constructor by using generateProductCode method. Initialize all the member variables.
	- Include an overloaded parameterized constructor with 2 parameter( productName, productPrice). prodCode should be assigned in constructor by using generateProductCode method. Category code should be assigned to ‘E’. Initialize all the member variables.
	- Include a method **getProductDetails** to format the product details. This method should return a String containing the product details in the below format

***Product : Code – 101, Name – Laptop, price - 45000.00, Category – E***

* Create class **TestProduct** with a main method to test above class
	- Create an object using the parameterized constructor with 3 parameters
	- Get the product details by invoking **getProductDetails** and display the details
	- Create another object using the parameterized constructor with 2 parameters
	- Get the product details by invoking **getProductDetails** and display the details.

6. Create a class named **Average**
	-	Include a static method named **avg**, which takes two integers as parameters and returns a double as average.
	-	Include an overloaded static method **avg**, which takes three integers as parameters and returns a double as average
	-	Include an overloaded static method named **avg**, which takes two doubles as parameters and returns a double as average
-  Create a class **TestAverage** with a main method.
	-	Test all the avg overloaded methods.

7. Write a program to create a class named **shape**. In this class we have three subclasses **circle**, **triangle** and **square** each class has two member functions named **draw ()** and **erase ()**. Create these using polymorphism concepts.

8. Write a program and create a class ‘**SimpleObject**‘. Using a constructor, display the message.
9. Write a program to Add two distances in **inch-feet** by creating a class named '**AddDistance**'.
